Security Policy
===============

Supported Versions
------------------

This project has a rolling release and we only support the latest state of the branch ``master``.
It is finally meant to be run as a centralized service by Emissions API.


Reporting a Vulnerability
-------------------------

If you find a security vulnerability, please report it by sending a mail to security@emissions-api.org.
We will discuss the problem internally and, if necessary, release a patched version as soon as possible.
